# RadixSort
C++ program to sort integers from a file using radix sort.

## Current limitations
* all input must be of equal length (currently set to 4)
* max of 10 input items only
* not standalone program

## To Do
* allow main to accept cli arguments
* change from static array to dynamic/vector
* allow for variable input sizes
* pass input amount as argument
* allow for different input data types (?)

## Purpose
Practicing data structures and sorting algorithms for [CSC 326](http://csicuny.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Courses/CSC-Computer-Science/300/CSC-326).
